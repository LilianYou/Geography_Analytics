In this exercise, I used four methods (linear, nearest, cubic, spline) to interpolate a randomly generated 2D field to a higher resolution, and added a new observation sample within kriging.m domain to enhance sampling coverage.

Data: <br>
x.txt <br>
y.txt <br>
geost_dat.mat <br>

Codes:
kriging.m <br>
lab8.m
