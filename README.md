# Geography_Analytics
## Section A
A list of exercises in analytical methods for geography research, including calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. This repository only includes my own course work. Thanks for the guidance from [Prof. Tim DeVries](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/tim-devries).

## Section B
A list of exercises in probability and statistics, multivariate analysis methods, and regression techniques in Geography. Examples are from cross-sectional and spatial data analyses, linear and non-linear regression models, models for qualitative and other discrete dependent variables models.
