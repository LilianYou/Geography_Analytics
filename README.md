# Geography_Analytics
A list of past exercises in analytical methods for geography research, including calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. This repository only includes my own course work. Thanks for the guidance from [Prof. Tim DeVries](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/tim-devries) which gives me a good start in analyzing environmental data.
